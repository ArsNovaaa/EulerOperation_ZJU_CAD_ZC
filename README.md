# 3D Cad Modeling's final assignment of ZJU 2023-2024 fall
## Implement :  
1、Define the half-side structure.  
2、Five basic Euler operations are implemented based on half-sided data structures.   
3、Sweep operation based on Euler operation (allows multiple inner rings within a 2D area).   
4、Realistic rendering of the solid model built by the sweep operation.    
## How to start :  
Enter  your local empty folder, then type  
`git clone https://github.com/ArsNovaaa/EulerOperation_ZJU_CAD_ZC.git `  
Just use your **Visual Studio** (it's better to use the version 2022) to open the **CadModeling.sln** file, then you can compile it directly.
## Visualizations :
